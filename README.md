# Loggin-Discord-Bot
This bot logs all messages sent in a channel it is in, and sends them to a log channel. You will have to specify the channel to send it to, and use your own bot token/ID.

If channels are being spammed extremely fast it will start to become behind on messages. Don't worry, it will catch up eventually.
