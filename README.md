# Loggin-Discord-Bot
This bot logs all messages sent in every channel it is in, and sends them to a log channel. You will have to specify the channel to send it to, and use your own bot token/ID.
<br><br>
The message format for the log is "[Username]: [Message]" There is a second version which has the format "#[channel]: [username]: [message]" which can be set up the same way.
<br><br>
If channels are being spammed extremely fast it will start to become behind on messages. Don't worry, it will catch up eventually.
<br><br><br>
To set up the bot, take the channel ID of the channel you want the bot to send the messages to, and replace "LoggingChannel" with it.<br>
Take the bot's token, and replace "BotToken" with it.
